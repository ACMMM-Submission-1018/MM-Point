## Dataset preparation

- ModelNet40
- ScanObjectNN
- ShapeNetPart
- S3DIS dataset

Please place the data set file in the 'data' directory of the project system and extract it

## Download the pre-trained model weights
> Please note that we upload through Baidu web disk, because the model weight file size is too large. 
**But the Baidu web disk account is a virtual user name, and the author's information has no connection, meet the principle of double blind review.**

## Downstream Tasks_ 3D Object Classification
Run 'val-modelnet40.ipynb' notebook to perform linear SVM 3D object classification in both **ModelNet40** datasets.

- The classification accuracy of **92.5%** is achieved in the code, **which is higher than reported in the paper**
- as shown in the figure below:

Run 'val-scanObjectnn.ipynb' notebook to perform linear SVM 3D object classification in **ScanObjectNN** datasets.
- The classification accuracy of **88.0%** is achieved in the code, **which is higher than reported in the paper**
- as shown in the figure below:
